# piUp
The goal of this project is to update a Raspberry Pi remotely using a custom script on a desired schedule.

## Scenario
I have a Raspberry Pi that I have [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) installed on and have my local network routing traffic through it to block ads.

This Raspberry Pi is setup headlessly and has no GUI. SSH access is available.
